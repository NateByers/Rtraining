## Exercises {#ex}

These exercises accompany the 
<a href="http://rpubs.com/NateByers/functions" target="_blank">Functions</a> tutorial. 

1. Write a function that checks if a value is above a threshold value.
The function should have two parameters: `x` which is the numeric value
to check, and `threshold` which is the numeric threshold. Have the 
function return a logical value, `TRUE` if the value is above the 
threshold and `FALSE` if it is equal to or below the threshold.

[Solution](#ex1)

2. Write a for loop that uses the function from the first exercise
and checks each value in the random vector `rnorm(n = 10, mean = 35, sd = 10)`
to see if it's above a threshold of 35.

[Solution](#ex2)

3. Use the function from the first exercise and the `sapply()` function to 
find out how many days had an 8-hour ozone value above 0.075 ppm in the
`chicago_air` dataset.

[Solution](#ex3)

4. Use the `mapply()` function to find out how many days had an 8-hour 
ozone value above 0.075, how many days had a temperature above 90, and
how many days had a solar radiation value above 1.25. (**Hint: You will have to
write a new threshold function to use in the `mapply()` function).

## Solutions

### Solution 1{#ex1}

Functions should have descriptive names that describe what the function 
does. Long names are better than shorter, less descriptive names.

```{r}
checkAboveThreshold <- function(x, standard){
  x > standard
}

checkAboveThreshold(x = 10, standard = 5)
```

### Solution 2 {#ex2}

To make the answer reproducible, we set the seed so that the random numbers
being generated can be recreated.

```{r}
set.seed(22)
y <- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 35, sd = 10)
y
above_threshold <- c()
for(i in 1:10){
  above_threshold[i] <- checkAboveThreshold(x = y[i], standard = 35)
}
data.frame(y, above_threshold)
```

### Solution 3 {#ex3}


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(region5air)
data(chicago_air)
head(chicago_air)
```

Before we can use our function, we need to modify it to handle `NA`s.

```{r}
checkAboveThreshold <- function(x, standard){
  if(is.na(x)){
    FALSE
  }else{
    x > standard
  }
}
```

Now we can use our threshold function and take advantage of the fact that,
in R, `TRUE` is equivalent to a numeric value of 1 and `FALSE` is equivalent
to 0.

```{r}
violation <- sapply(chicago_air$ozone, checkAboveThreshold, standard = 0.075)
head(violation)
total_violations <- sum(violation)
total_violations
```

### Solution 4 {#ex4}

First, we make our own table with a parameter column and the corresponding
threshold.

```{r}
my_thresholds <- data.frame(parameter = c("ozone", "temp", "solar"),
                            threshold = c(0.075, 90, 1.25),
                            stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
my_thresholds
```

Next we write a function that will take the two values in each row
and find the sum of days above the threshold for that parameter.

```{r}
sumAboveThreshold <- function(values, threshold){
  sum(sapply(values, checkAboveThreshold, standard = threshold))
}
```
Now we feed `mapply()` our new function and use the `my_thresholds`
data frame to feed the arguments.

```{r}
mapply(FUN = sumAboveThreshold, chicago_air[, my_thresholds$parameter],
       my_thresholds$threshold)
```
