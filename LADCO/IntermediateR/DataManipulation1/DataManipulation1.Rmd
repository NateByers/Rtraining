`dplyr` is an [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html) written
by [Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz/). It makes data manipulation of data frames easier and quicker.

This tutorial will cover the following functions in the `dplyr` package:

- [select()](#select), selecting columns
- [arrange()](#arrange), reordering rows
- [filter()](#filter), filtering rows
- [summarise()](#summarise), summarizing rows

We will be using the `airdata` dataset from the `region5air` package.

```{r}
library(region5air)
data(airdata)
```

For each function we will review how to accomplish the task in base R, then see
how the dplyr function accomplishes the same task.

# Select columns with select() {#select}

If we wanted to select a few columns from `airdata`, we would need to either use numbers or 
names. Suppose we just wanted the site, time, parameter, and value:

```{r}
b <- airdata[, c("site", "datetime", "parameter", "value")]

# equivalently
# b <- airdata[, c(1, 4, 5, 8)]

head(b, 3)
```

With the `select()` function, you don't need to put the columns in quotes.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
d <- select(airdata, site, datetime, parameter, value)
head(d, 3)
```

You can also select consective columns by separating the first column and the last column with 
a colon.

```{r}
# in base R
b <- airdata[, c(1, 4:8)]
head(b, 3)

d <- select(airdata, site, datetime:value)
head(d, 3)
```

# Arrange rows with arrange() {#arrange}

If we wanted to arrange `airdata` by first ordering by parameter then odering chronologically,
this is how we would do it in base R.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
airdata <- airdata[order(airdata$parameter, airdata$datetime), ]
```

The `arrange()` function in `dplyr` allows you to order a data frame by just adding the column 
names as parmeters. Use `desc()` to arrange in descending order.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
airdata <- arrange(airdata, desc(parameter), datetime)
```

# Filter rows with filter() {#filter}

To filter a data frame we need to use a logical vector. For example, if we wanted to filter `airdata` by
pollutant and POC, we would do something like this in base R.

```{r}
b <- airdata[airdata$parameter  == 62101 & airdata$poc == 1, ]
dim(b)
```

The `filter()` function in `dplyr` takes logical expressions as parameters (commas are equivalent to
`&`).

```{r}
d <- filter(airdata, parameter == 62101, poc == 1)
dim(d)
```

# summarise rows with group_by() and summarise() {#summarise}

Suppose we want to summarise the value for each day in `airdata`. The first thing we need to do is create a date column, so we use another handy-Hadley package called `stringr`. The `str_split_fixed` function will split a character vector and return a fixed number of columns.

```{r}
library(stringr)
date_time <- str_split_fixed(airdata$datetime, pattern = "T", n = 2)
head(date_time, 3)
```

The first column is the date, so we'll add that to `airdata`.

```{r}
airdata$date <- date_time[, 1]
```

In base R, we can summarise the mean of each day by using the `tapply()` function (see `?tapply()`). Let's find the daily mean for a given site and a given parameter.

```{r}
ozone_site_A <- airdata[airdata$site == 840170311601 & airdata$parameter == 44201, ]
daily_mean <- tapply(ozone_site_A$value, ozone_site_A$date, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
head(daily_mean, 3)
```

To use `tapply()` you work with vectors. You supply the vector you want to apply the `mean()` function to (`ozone_site_A$value`), and you supply the vector that will be a factor for aggregation (`ozone_site_A$date`). 

`dplyr` accomplishes this task by allowing you to use data frames and their column names. The first step is to use the `group_by()` function to pick the columns that will be factors (groups will be created by the 
levels of these columns).

```{r}
d_daily_mean <- group_by(airdata, site, parameter, date)
```

The `summarise()` function will split up the column by grouping together cells that have
common factor levels in the site, parameter, and date columns.

```{r}
d_daily_mean <- summarise(d_daily_mean, daily_mean = mean(value, na.rm = FALSE))
head(d_daily_mean, 3)
```

The resulting [data frame](#classes) has just three columns: site, parameter, date, and daily_mean. Instead
of subsetting down to one site and one parameter before calculating the daily mean, `summarise()` will take
all of the grouping information from the `group_by` function and calculate all of the daily values for
each site and parameter.

```{r}
table(d_daily_mean[, c("site", "parameter")])
```


# `dplyr` classes {#classes}

The output of some `dplyr` functions aren't always strictly a `data.frame`. For instance, the output of the `group_by` function is an object with the following classes: `grouped_df`, `tbl_df`, `tbl`, and `data.frame`. This is something to be aware of, if you find your `dplyr` output won't behave the way
a `data.frame` normally should.

# Additional comments on `dplyr` 

- Some functions don't appear to be that much easier to use than base R (like `select()` or `arrange()`). But `dplyr` provides a suite of functions _with the same syntax_ so that you can easily remember them. 
- `dplyr` is fast.
- You can use `dplyr` with databases.
