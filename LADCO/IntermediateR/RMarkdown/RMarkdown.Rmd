R Markdown is a platform developed by RStudio for creating dynamic documents.
Using the R Markdown syntax, you can create HTML, PDF, and Word documents. You 
can also make slide presentations. See RStudio's site for full documentation:
[rmarkdown.rstudio.com](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

This tutorial covers the following topics:

## Getting started {#start}

Starting an R Markdown document is very easy. You can click on the document
icon in RStudio in the upper left hand corner.

Choose R Markdown.

You can then enter information about the title, the author, and the output
format.

Once you click OK, there will be a new document in the top left corner of RStudio
with some pre-populated information.

The information at the very top between the triple dashes is called the header.
That is information that determines how the document will be rendered. You can 
edit the title, author, and date directly in the header. However, if you change
any of the formatting, or change other information, it may break the document.

To render this document in HTML, click on the "Knit HTML" button.

Provide a file name for the document and save it.

RStudio will knit everything together and render the HTML in a window.
